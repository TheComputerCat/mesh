# Solving a CSP
This is a work-in-progress implementation of a CSP solver for clinic shift scheduling.
## How to Run the Code:

1. **Generate the Constraint Function Code:**
   Run the following command to generate the constraint functions:
```bash
   $ python3 -m src.constraints_creator
```
2. **Run the Solver:** After generating the constraints, run the solver with the command:
```bash
    $ python3 CSP.py
```
This will output a solution to the CSP.

Note: Not all rules have been implemented yet.
